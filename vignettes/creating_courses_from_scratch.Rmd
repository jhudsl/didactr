# Quick rundown

## Creating a Course
1. Open RStudio.
2. Install `didactr`
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/didactr")
```
3.  Load `didactr`.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(didactr)
```
4. Create a course.  Change `course_name` to your course name, and change `root_path` to where you want the course created on disk:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
didactr::create_course(
  course_name = "My Course Name", 
  root_path = "/path/to/course/on/disk", 
  open = TRUE)
```
This should open up a new RStudio session.  Make sure you run: 
```{r}
library(didactr)
```
in your new session.

## Creating a Lesson 

5.  Go to your Google Slide deck and copy the URL from the slide deck

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/copy_url.png")
```

6. Create a lesson.  For your lesson, change `How to Do Things` to something more appropriate and run in your new session, pasting in the slide URL:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
out = didactr::create_lesson(
  lesson_name = "How to Do Things",
  course_dir = ".",
  slide_id = "URL FOR GOOGLE SLIDE DECK",
  make_slide_deck = TRUE,
  open = TRUE)
```



# Full Documentation

You should have the most up to date RStudio downloaded and installed.

# If you don't have `didactr` installed

If you do not have `didactr` installed, you can run the following command: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("muschellij2/didactr")
```



# Setting up a Temporary Course

Let's load in the `didactr` library:
```{r load_lib}
library(didactr)
```

In this tutorial we will work in temporary directories in `R`.  In your case, you want to change `root_path` to a folder on your computer where your class will live.  The class folder will be in `root_path/course_name`.  Run the code below, changing `root_path` to a path on your computer where you want the course folder.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
root_path = tempfile()
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
root_path = "/the/path/to/your/course"
```

(In this example, we are setting it to a temporary directory so it deletes itself once we're done.)

Here we will call our course name `test`.  For course names, these should not have any spaces; all slide decks will have the `course_name` prepended on them (for example `test_00_first_lecture`).  The `create_course` function will create the course.  Run the code below, changing `test` to the name of the course that you want.  If do not want `R` to open up the `R` project (in the directory of the course), set `open = FALSE` in the code below:


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
course_name = "test"
sc = didactr::create_course(course_name, root_path, open = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
course_name = "test"
sc = didactr::create_course(course_name, root_path, open = FALSE)
```

Make sure you run: 
```{r}
library(didactr)
```
in your new session.

We see the paths that have been created for the project. You may ask yourself "Why were all these folders created?"; we discuss below the folder structure necessary for Leanpub courses.  

**For the rest of the code below, you need to go to your course directory.  You can do this by opening (on your machine) your `course_name.Rproj` file in your course directory (in our example `test.Rproj`).**

## If you have a PowerPoint or PDF

This workflow uses Google Slides to create your video and your document.  We **highly** recommend this process.  If you have a local presentation and you want to use that, go to https://drive.google.com (by clicking on the link).  Once on Google Drive, click the New button:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/New.png")
```

After clicking that, select "File Upload":

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/Upload.png")
```

Then upload your deck.

## Starting with a Google Slide Deck
```{r, echo = FALSE}
x = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tg-GTGnUPduOtZKYuMoelqUNZnUp3vvg_7TtpUPL7e8/edit#slide=id.g154aa4fae2_0_58"
```

If you start with a Google Slide deck, you need the Slide ID.  Please go to the slide deck on Google Slides, and then copy the URL from the browser address bar: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/copy_url.png")
```

For example, let's say we copied `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tg-GTGnUPduOtZKYuMoelqUNZnUp3vvg_7TtpUPL7e8/edit#slide=id.g154aa4fae2_0_58` from our address bar.  The ID is `r ariExtra::get_slide_id(x)`, and `didactr` provides the helper function `ariExtra::get_slide_id` that takes in this URL and provides the slide ID.  You can either copy just the slide ID or run `ariExtra::get_slide_id` on your URL as the example below demonstrates.

```{r}
my_slide_url = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tg-GTGnUPduOtZKYuMoelqUNZnUp3vvg_7TtpUPL7e8/edit#slide=id.g154aa4fae2_0_58"
slide_id = ariExtra::get_slide_id(my_slide_url)
slide_id
# copy this to slide_id
# for example:
# slide_id = "1Tg-GTGnUPduOtZKYuMoelqUNZnUp3vvg_7TtpUPL7e8"
```

If you don't have start with a slide deck, you can simply run the `create_lesson` command and it will create a Google Slide deck copy from one we provide.  If you do not have a slide deck, you can run:

```{r}
slide_id = NULL
```

Otherwise, you should run the command, where you removed the example URL and put in your own URL:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
slide_id = ariExtra::get_slide_id("URL FOR GOOGLE SLIDE DECK")
```
Before we actually make the lesson, please read this note on authorization.

## Creating the Lesson 

The `create_lesson` function will pop up windows for you to the authorize `didactr` to work with your Google Drive/Google Slides.  

Accept the permissions to use `didactr`. It will ask you once for Google, once for YouTube. 

**NOTE**: this function will make your slide deck public.  This is so that Leanpub can download your slides into your manuscript. 

Now, let's create our lesson.  For your lesson, change `How to Do Things` to something more appropriate and run:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sc = check_structure(course_dir = ".", create_directories = FALSE)
stopifnot(dir.exists(sc$man_path))
out = didactr::create_lesson(
  lesson_name = "How to Do Things",
  course_dir = sc$course_dir,
  make_slide_deck = TRUE,
  slide_id = slide_id,
  open = TRUE)
out
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
out = didactr::create_lesson(
  lesson_name = "How to Do Things",
  course_dir = sc$course_dir,
  make_slide_deck = TRUE,
  slide_id = slide_id,
  open = FALSE)
out
```

## Viewing the Lesson 
Run `leanpub_render` to view the output of your lesson:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
didactr::leanpub_render(out$md_file)
```

If you are including `png` or other files with **links** and not included in the `manuscript/resources/images` folder in your course, then you must specify the format before the Markdown.  For example if you want to include a PNG from Google Slides, we can use the following lines:

```yaml
{format: png}
![](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/143gvqcynq_bl7iVd2G9yjumwJJkAy0S6CyNCsrJ2LgE/export/png?id=143gvqcynq_bl7iVd2G9yjumwJJkAy0S6CyNCsrJ2LgE&pageid=p)
```

# Courses using `didactr`

In `didactr`, we not only create a Leanpub course, which has text and quizzes, we also create automated videos.  You do not have to create these videos to use `didactr` and can use `didactr` only to create Leanpub courses on their own without videos.  


## Video Generation 

If you want to generate videos for a lesson, you need [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).  You need to make sure you have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) version 3.2.4 or higher installed on your system.  If you would like to try to install `ffmpeg` automatically, please try:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
didactr::install_ffmpeg()
```

If a path comes up, you have `ffmpeg` installed!  If not you can go to https://ffmpeg.org/ for instructions on installation.  Some recommendations are: 

* OSX: using [Brew](https://brew.sh/) `brew install ffmpeg`.  See the Brew page for `brew` installation.
* Linux variants: `sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg`
* Windows: using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install ffmpeg`

### Creating a video from a Google Slides Deck

If you have a Google Slides presentation with the text to be spoken over the slides in the speaker notes section of the presentation, you can run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res = gs_ari(id = "URL FOR GOOGLE SLIDE DECK")
```


If you choose to create videos with `didactr` we have additional things we need over and above what Leanpub need:

1. A `scripts` folder which contains `.md` files that correspond to the spoken words to be said over the slides.  These are plain text (not markdown) and "special" words need to be phonetically spelled, such as `R Studio`.  Each newline separates slides, so there needs to be the same number of non-empty lines as the number of slides in the slide deck.
2.  A `manuscript/resources/videos` folder which contains the synthesized videos from the Google Slide deck and the script.  The audio is generated by Amazon Polly.  
  - If you want to create videos with automated voices, you need to create an Amazon account.  See https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.signature for more information.

## Specification for a Script

A script file must have as many non-empty lines as there are slides.  If you don't want any text read over the slide, simply add a simple semicolon `";"` or comman `","`.  

# Checking a Course

The `check_course` function is the main function for determining if the structure of the course is setup correctly.  This checks **a lot** of different folders and such.  If you've created the course using `create_course`, these should likely have been created already.  Videos and other resources _

```{r}
result = didactr::check_course(course_dir = sc$course_dir, check_youtube_links = FALSE)
result$course_summary
```
If there are multiple warnings, this may be due to the YouTube links not included, the Google Slide ID not included, or the number of paragraphs in the scripts not matching up with the number of slides.  

# Changes to Manuscript files

Now that you have a lesson created, you likely want to change the content and the slides over time.  Let's say you want to include a slide, you can use the `gs_slide_df` function.  The output is a `tibble` with a lot of elements.  You can extract `objectId` to grab the "page" identifier, which is unique to that specific slide in the deck.  Note, the ID and slide ID combination **together** make it unique over all of Google, not simply the page ID.  For example, most first slides have the ID `p`.

```{r}
slide_df = didactr::gs_slide_df(id = result$course_summary$id[1])
slide_df$objectId
```

## Code inside a text box

If you have code in a Google Slide deck and want to extract it, you must mark in the Google Slide Deck.  You can either:

1. You can add `#rstats` to the text box anywhere.
2. Right click the text box and add the title `#rstats` to the Alt-text.  Right click the text box → `Alt text...` → Title `#rstats`.

For example, we have a slide deck with some code and here is the output:
```{r}
out_rmd = didactr::create_lesson(
  lesson_name = "An example with some code",
  course_dir = sc$course_dir,
  slide_id = "1Tg-GTGnUPduOtZKYuMoelqUNZnUp3vvg_7TtpUPL7e8",
  extract_code = TRUE,
  rmd = TRUE,
  open = FALSE)
x = readLines(out_rmd$md_file)
ind = grep("```\\{r [^setup]", x)[1]
cat(x[(ind - 5):(ind + 14)], sep = "\n")
```


## Keeping Repositories Light
As videos can be very large, we likely don't want to upload them to spaces like GitHub. As such, by default, the videos directory is excluded from `git`:
```{r}
readLines(file.path(sc$course_dir, ".gitignore"))
```

Now we will create a lesson in that course.  There are a few ways to do this.  If you have Markdown/`md` files already and have a `Book.txt`, which is required for Leanpub, then you want to look at the `create_lessons_from_book` function.  As we are starting from **scratch**, we will assume you have at most a Google Slides deck, but this is not required.


## Leanpub courses

If you've never created a Leanpub, the structure is that the top-level folder is a course.  The course has the following components:

1. A `manuscript` folder with a Markua/`md` file for each lesson.  [Markua](https://leanpub.com/markua/read) is a subset of Markdown, but has additional elements for quizzes and other teaching.
2. A `Book.txt` in the `manuscript` folder. This `Book.txt` is a simple text file that determines the order of the lessons, with one line for each `.md` file. The suffix needs to be included and the file names need to match exactly.
3. A `manuscript/resources` folder, which contains an `images` sub-folder with `png`/images for each lesson.  We will not use these in this workflow as all images are directly encoded from a Google Slide deck.


## Making Local Data

If you want to take the Google Slides and download them into individual PNGs so you can view them, the `gs_convert` takes in an ID and then converts the images to PNGs.  This requires the `convert` function and ImageMagick being installed.  If you use the `gs_convert(..., use_gs_ids = TRUE)`, the files will be named using the Google Slide page ID, which can allow you to "link" the image to the ID, so you can use

```yaml
{format: png}
![](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/SLIDE_ID/export/png?id=SLIDE_ID&pageid=PAGE_ID)
```

in your manuscript files, shere `SLIDE_ID` is the Google Slide deck ID and `PAGE_ID` is the page ID given by the filename of the png when `use_gs_ids = TRUE`.  


## Troubleshooting

If this errors, that is due to the fact that you are not in your course directory when running it.  You must either change the directory to the course directory (using `setwd`) or open your course folder and open the file that has the extension `.Rproj` to open a new `R` session with the right directory set and then run the above commands.

Here we break down the arguments we specified.  Whenever `create_lesson`, you must supply a `lesson_name` (in our case `"How to Do Things"`).  This can have spaces if you want and will be the title of the lesson.  We will pass the course directory in here from our `sc` object, otherwise it assumes we are creating this in the current working directory.  The `slide_id` again is the slide identifier for a Google Slide deck.  The ID can be extracted from the URL manually or running `ariExtra::get_slide_id` on the URL.  If you do not specify a slide ID, the `make_slide_deck` argument determines if you would like to create a slide deck.  If `TRUE`, it copies a template; if `FALSE` it does not make a slide deck.   **NB:** if you're creating a slide deck, we are copying over a slide deck from a different Google Drive and may take a few seconds due to the Google Drive API.

The `md_file` argument allows you to override the standard naming convention we recommend, the `rmd` argument says whether you'd like to use an Rmarkdown vs. Markdown document.  The argument `open` determines if you'd like to edit the document and script after creating it. 

We see the output is the Markdown file, slide ID for the deck, and the output script file (to be spoken over the slides).  Here is the output of the MD file:

```{r}
readLines(out$md_file)
```

Notably, we see that any area of "Notes" in the Google Slide deck is copied to the manuscript.  This is also done for the `script`:

```{r}
readLines(out$script_file)
```

### Pandoc

If you have `pandoc` installed and want to make sure that things should render, run:

```{r}
rmarkdown:::pandoc_available("1.20")
```

and make sure this is `TRUE`.
